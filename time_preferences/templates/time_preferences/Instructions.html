            <p>You are presented with <strong>10</strong> decision tasks. &nbsp;You will make a decision in all <strong>10</strong> and then <strong>one will be selected at random</strong>. &nbsp;Below you will see a sample of this screen. &nbsp;The decisions all have a similar format. For example, look at <strong>Decision 1</strong> at the top. <strong>Option A</strong> pays <strong>100 one month from now</strong> and <strong>Option B pays 105.09 thirteen months from now</strong>. If you choose <strong>Option B</strong> you will earn an <strong>annual return of 5%</strong> on the <strong>100</strong> you choose to receive <strong>13 months from now</strong>. Since this is <strong>compounded quarterly</strong> your <strong>annual effective interest rate is 5.09%</strong>. The only difference in the other nine decisions is that as you move down the table the payoffs for <strong>Option B</strong> increase. You have a<strong> 1-in-10</strong> chance of being paid for one of the decision problems which will be decided by rolling a ten-sided die.</p>
            <p>For the selected decision we will pay you according to your selected option.
               You will then receive the money at the date you choose. You will receive written
               confirmation of your payment today, and we will transfer the money to your
               personal bank account at the specified date.</p>
